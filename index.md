## R&D: Latent Variable Models
- I am particularly interested in the development of novel latent variable models to clinical applications. I enjoy doing this sort of original methodological work
- Software development is essential to implementation of modern methods, and R is the perfect platform for this

## R&D: Regulatory Pathway 
- I spent a lot of time thinking about the analyses described in the FDA COA Guidance 3 and 4 and how current practice can be improved
- Recent FDA interactions have focused on handling missing data
- Psychometric analyses can be better aligned with existing statistical literature on techniques for missing data

## Training Modules: Statistical Programming in R
- Currently working on building out the R training modules for my team
- Modules include data generation, model fitting, and generating output
- These tools are available for staffers to help them develop a suite of skills
