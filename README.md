### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Currently working on building out the R training modules for my team. 
- R&D interests: I am particularly interested in the development of novel latent variable models to clinical applications. This requires some original methodological work. 
- FDA Guidance: I spent a lot of time thinking about the analyses described in the FDA COA Guidance 3 and 4 and how current practice can be improved.
